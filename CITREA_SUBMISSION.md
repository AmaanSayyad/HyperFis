# HyperFi: Bitcoin DeFi Made Simple

## Project Overview

HyperFi is a DeFi aggregator and yield optimization platform built specifically for Bitcoin on Citrea's zkEVM Layer 2. Our platform enables Bitcoin holders to access sophisticated DeFi services natively without wrapped tokens, providing a seamless experience for users seeking to earn yield on their BTC holdings.

## How HyperFi Leverages Citrea

HyperFi fully embraces Citrea's zkEVM technology to bring Ethereum's smart contract capabilities to Bitcoin:

1. **Native Bitcoin Integration**: Users interact directly with their BTC without wrapping or bridging
2. **Smart Contract Functionality**: Implementing complex DeFi strategies using Solidity on Bitcoin
3. **Scalability**: Fast and affordable transactions compared to Bitcoin's base layer
4. **Security**: Inheriting Bitcoin's security while enabling complex financial operations

## Key Features

### 1. Bitcoin APY Aggregator ("Trivago of Bitcoin DeFi")

- Tracks and compares yields across multiple Bitcoin DeFi protocols
- Calculates a "Power Index" to help users identify the best opportunities
- Provides real-time data on protocol performance

### 2. Bitcoin Yield Strategies

- **Lending**: Lend BTC and earn interest directly
- **Liquidity Provision**: Provide liquidity to BTC trading pairs
- **Staking**: Stake BTC in various protocols

### 3. Compound Calculator

- Projects BTC growth over time based on selected strategies
- Accounts for Bitcoin-specific factors in yield calculations
- Helps users visualize the potential growth of their BTC holdings

### 4. Educational Resources

- Extensive guides on Bitcoin DeFi concepts
- Interactive tutorials for new users
- Risk assessment tools for different strategies

## Technical Implementation

### Smart Contract Architecture

HyperFi's contracts on Citrea include:

- **HyperFiBitcoinDeFi.sol**: Core contract for managing Bitcoin DeFi protocols and APY tracking
- **BitcoinYieldStrategies.sol**: Implementation of various yield strategies for Bitcoin
- **APYAggregator.sol**: Modified to track Bitcoin DeFi protocols

### Deployment Process

HyperFi is deployed on Citrea's testnet with:

1. Custom Hardhat configuration for Citrea
2. Deployment scripts optimized for Citrea's environment
3. Contract verification on Citrea's block explorer
