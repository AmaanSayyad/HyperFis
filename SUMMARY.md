# HyperFi for Citrea Wave Pool: Project Summary

## Overview of Changes

We've adapted the HyperFi project to leverage Citrea's zkEVM Layer 2 solution for Bitcoin, creating a Bitcoin-native DeFi platform that aligns with the Citrea Wave Pool requirements. Here's a summary of the changes and additions:

## 1. Smart Contracts

### New Contracts
- **HyperFiBitcoinDeFi.sol**: Core contract for managing Bitcoin DeFi protocols and APY tracking on Citrea
- **BitcoinYieldStrategies.sol**: Implementation of various yield strategies for Bitcoin
- **MockERC20.sol**: Testing utility for simulating BTC on Citrea

### Modified Approach
- Adapted the APY aggregator concept to focus specifically on Bitcoin DeFi protocols
- Implemented native Bitcoin handling through Citrea's zkEVM
- Created yield strategies optimized for Bitcoin holders

## 2. Deployment & Testing

- **hardhat.config.citrea.js**: Custom Hardhat configuration for Citrea deployment
- **deploy_citrea.js**: Deployment script for Citrea testnet
- **HyperFiBitcoinDeFi.test.js**: Test suite for the core contract

## 3. Documentation

- **README.md**: Updated to highlight Bitcoin and Citrea integration
- **CITREA_INTEGRATION.md**: Detailed explanation of HyperFi's integration with Citrea
- **CITREA_SUBMISSION.md**: Formal submission document for the Citrea Wave Pool
- **Architecture Diagram**: Visual representation of HyperFi on Citrea
